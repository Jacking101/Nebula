	<b>SUBJECT:</b> Standing Orders<br>
	<hr>
	Captain.<br>
	Your orders are to visit the following star systems. Keep in mind that your supplies are limited; ration exploration time accordingly.
	<li>[generate_system_name()]</li>
	<li>[generate_system_name()]</li>
	<li>[generate_system_name()]</li>

	<li>[generate_system_name()]</li>
	<br>
	Priority targets are artifacts of uncontacted alien species and signal sources of unknown origin.<br>
	None of these systems are claimed by any entity recognized by the ISEO, so you have full salvage rights on any derelicts discovered.<br>
	Investigate and mark any prospective colony worlds as per usual procedures.<br>
	There is no ISEO presence in that area. In case of distress calls, you will be the only vessel available; our position in the eyes of the galaxy is tenuous at best.<br>
	The current docking code is: [torch.docking_codes]<br>
	Report all findings via superluminal comm buoys during inter-system jumps.<br>

	<b>FROM:</b> Johnathan Smitherson, Special Aide of the Secretary General<br>

	<hr>
	This is a small addendum to the usual operating procedures. Unlike the rest of SOP, this is not left to the Commanding Officer's discretion and is mandatory. As unconventional as this is, we felt it is essential for smooth operation of this mission.<br>
	Procedure can be initiated only by transmission from ISEO Expeditionary Command via secure channel. The sender may not introduce themselves, but you shouldn't have trouble confirming the transmission source, I believe.<br>
	The signal to initiate the procedure are codewords 'GOOD NIGHT WORLD' used in this order as one phrase. You do not need to send acknowledgement.
	<li>Information about this expedition's findings is to be treated as secret and vital to the ISEO's operational security, and is protected under codeword UMBRA. Only National-Council affiliated ISEO employees the ISEO Endeavour are allowed access to this information on a need-to-know basis.</li>
	<li>The secrecy of this information is to be applied retroactively. Any non-cleared personnel who were exposed to such information are to be secured and transferred to DIA on arrival at home port.</li>
	<li>Any devices capable of transmitting or receiving data at interstellar range are to be confiscated from private possession.</li>
	<li>Disregard any systems remaining in your flight plan and set course for Sol, Neptune orbit. You will be contacted upon your arrival. Do not make stops in ports on the way unless absolutely necessary.</li>
	<br>
	While drastic, I assure you this is a simple precaution, lest any issues. Just keep the option open, and carry on with your normal duties.
